## DumbBot

This is the 'DumbBot', a 4 wheeled, Rear Wheel Differential Drive robot made for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Inspired by the robots from the AI Tool Kit (AITK) this project seeks to implement a real-world version of these robots which students can use to create visual sensing AI robots. This project is meant to be cheap, easy to produce and available to computer science AI students who can now receive some formal engineering experience.
